# SplitShow #
A tool for the dual-head presentation of PDF slides on Mac OS X, most likely using a laptop and a projector. The project arose out of the need to correctly project slides created with LaTeX's [beamer class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer).

This project has been **imported from the original, discotinued Google Code project** ([http://splitshow.googlecode.com](http://splitshow.googlecode.com)).
The aim is to create an up-to-date version of the SplitShow program with the same features and to extend it later on.

## Dual-Head Full Screen Mode at Native Resolutions ##
Traditional PDF viewers require two displays to be in "mirror" mode in order to show the same image on both. The -- maybe not so obvious -- disadvantage of this is that the higher-resolution display is forced to used the resolution of the lower-resolution one. By keeping the two displays at their respective native resolutions in "extended desktop" mode, your slides will always look great on either side.
